**Overview :** 



This project is about a new login feature for a secure application. I have performed the Requirement Analysis to find some functional and non-functional requirements and created a high level Test plan, which includes some of the key aspects of the project.

As part of the manual testing,  I have performed an Exploratory Testing and a Scripted testing where I have documented some potential issues and also executed the test cases that were designed.

As part of the automation testing, I have set up the environment and using Playwright(Typescript) in Visual Studio code, developed automation scripts for the login form that basically performs test for login functionality by entering the valid credentials and adding some assertions.

Finally, documented the most significant bug in the format that we create in JIRA and worked on one of the challenging tasks that shows the problem-solving ability of the QA.



**Challenges :** 



One challenge I faced during the automation was a pop-up /a dialogue box, that popped up when the Login button was clicked, which couldn't be inspected in the DOM. I have gone through the Playwright/dev and found that an event/class name "dialogue" needs to be included in the code to handle the alerts, and that resolved the problem.
