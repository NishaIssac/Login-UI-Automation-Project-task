Vending Machine

1. How would you approach testing its functionality and quality, relying only on user-facing interactions and observable outcomes

 (i) **Verify button responsiveness:**  Checking if all the buttons are pressable/tappable

 (ii) **Confirm dispensing behavior:** Check that all the buttons/options are in working condition(that it dispenses a drink when pressed)

 (iii) **Validate Selection:** Check if the intended button/option gives you only the chosen drink and not the wrong one

 (iv) **Label Clarity and visibility:** Check if the user can read all the drink names, they are correct, and are visible properly

 (V) **Transaction behavior:** The next drink can be chosen only when the previous request, along with the payment, is completed


2. List the aspects

 (i) **User interactions:** Check how the system interacts when a kid is pressing different options at a time, or an adult, or a disabled person

 (ii) **Handle Types Of Inputs:** Check if the system accepts different types of inputs by inserting a variety of coins and rejects invalid coins

 (iii) **Cancellation and reselection:** Check if the system can handle the cancellation of the item/rechoosing it

 (iv) **Quantity validation:** Check if the system can handle multiple quantities. The system should dispense the correct number of quantities chosen

 (v) **Input mismatch:** Check if the system provides a message when the input is unmatched with an item
